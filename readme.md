# **Responsible Consumption**

##### This web app is designed to help people with their recreational use of cannabis. Far too often people with little experience don't know how much to consume which will often lead to bad experiences.

## **Documentation:**
##### GET: /api/signin
    should fetch existing user

##### POST: /api/signup
    should create new user obj

##### POST: something
    output


## **Development Plan:**
### --MVP--
  * User, Product, and Store schemas that are all interlinked with each other
  * smart error handling with if statements, catch blocks, and error-middleware
  * testing coverage of around 90%
  * a signin route that GETs an existing user and a signup route that POST a new user
  * users are able to POST information about themselves and get a estimated safe dose level
  * users are able to search for products based on dosage, name, type, etc.

### --Stretch Goals--
  * allows user to POST reviews on products
  * allows user to update their account with a PUT request
  * updates estimated dosage level based on recent reviews
